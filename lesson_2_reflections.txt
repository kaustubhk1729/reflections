What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Transform the current directory into a Git repository. This adds a .git subdirectory to the current directory and makes it possible to start recording revisions of the project.It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new empty repository.The .git subdirectory contains all of the necessary metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is intermediate between the working directory on our computer and the commited git repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Commit master only after all changes are done till then only git add.
